# Array Binary Search
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

This one took a long time, although it's not actually that hard I still had a pretty hard time with it.
the code is probably not efficient at all haha.
