# stack-and-queue
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency
Stack: 
`peek()` is O(1)
`pop()` is O(1)
`push()` is O(1)
`isEmpty()` is O(1)

Queue: 
`enqueue()` is O(n)
`dequeue()` is O(1)
`peek()` is O(1)
`isEmpty()` is O(1)
